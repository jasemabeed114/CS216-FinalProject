    "comments": [
        "The game is fun, the app is poor. - Asks for photos and location permissions on every launch, gives no reason why. - Multiplayer uses codes you need to send each other rather than Google play games. - The share path for these codes doesn't work and you need to manually text the code to someone by remembering it and typing it. - Once you are in a game you only get to play once. No way to start a other game without manually sending another code.",
        "The app is fun, but there are no achievements. Because there's nothing to strive for, there's no competition. There's not even a leaderboard. If I got points for winning that I could buy avatars with (instead of spending real money on avatars), then I'd have a goal--which, in turn, would make me play more since I would want to reach that goal. Right now, there are no goals; there are no achievements; there are no leaderboards. Without them, I have no incentive to play--it's not THAT fun.",
        "DO NOT BUY YET! The game crashed once and now refuses to open. Reinstalling did not fix the issue. You should also know that there are additional card packs and avatars for $2 each. I feel cheated out of my money.",
        "It's a great way to sneak in a quick game of EK on the go or when you can't actually meet up with your usual game mates.  Lots of fun for sure.  One criticism would be that there is no in-game chat (just pre fab comments).  Please add that function!",
        "Game fun, app terrible.  Have to text code to friend and then app restarts when I go back to it. When you finish game have to start over at main menu instead of just continuing playing same people.  Would be really nice if you could save friends in there so you didn't have to mess with codes",
        "The game is extremely addicting. I can't stop playing until I've won, and the players always slap me a bunch of times at the end, so that doesn't happen too often. Anyways, I have played this in real life and to be honest I would prefer the card game itself to this, but this game is really convenient and I like the gameplay."

        "Wow, they weren't kidding about the lag and unresponsive controls. Great game,  very frustrating experience",
        "Love OOTP,  this is extremely buggy. Click on a button and one of three things happen: goes to some random page, nothing happens, or if you're really lucky it'll take you where you're clicking. Also get a ton of messages from free agents telling me they want more money but I can't offer them a new contract. Huge waste of money!",
        "Excellent game. Touch screen a little slow reacting, but I'm using 8.1\" tablet, keep my screen clean & use new stylus improves reaction time. I really don't have much anything to complain about. Excellent companion if you have PC 18 version. Always have had excellent experience with this company too",
        "The app for me is basically unusable due to the new smaller, more cluttered interface. I buy this game every year and I am so disappointed that this will be the first year I won't.",
        "A fantastic game for a hardcore baseball fan.",

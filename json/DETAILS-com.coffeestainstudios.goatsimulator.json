A few things that your can do in this simulator are completing quests to unlock different goats with special powers one is the goats that you unlock is a giant goat. One funny thing that your can do in this simulator is that you can pick up people with the goats tongue NO JOKE! I would take recommend this game is you like funny simulators!",
        "Before the game was free; I had to pay and my phone stopped turning on because of bugs. But now it's the same thing but FREE and NO BUGS!!! Thank you so much for fixing it. Now I can feel like I'm playing this game with my cousin on his Xbox. XD ( takes forever to install so write a review while waiting )",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! THE ONLY THING THAT IM BUMBED ABOUT IS HOW MUCH MB IT TAKES AND MY TABLET DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MEGABYTES!üò¢üò¢üò¢üòßüò¶       But goat sim is fun and odd which I like!! I my opinion I think coffee stain studios are the best devs and I like your coffee stain studio easter eggs       If you like a game with a lot of secrets and easter eggs this game is for you!! Overall I think its worth 25 stars!!!üòé",

        "It's a fun stupid waste of time. The first game I have ever bought and am glad I did. The developers comments are spot on. But hey, the purpose of games is to have fun right?  And pretty fun to be a stupid mindless goat causing stupid mindless mayhem.",
        "My sister had this game and she let me play it and it's AMAZING. You do haft to pay and wait a LONG LONG time to download, but it's worth it. In my opinion, if someone does not like it I hate you! Sorry, but it's soo good!üòÅüòÄüòÇ"

        "1st reaction was WOW! Incredible graphics, player game motions, cut scenes, and Play by play...on a $30 smartphone app!? Blown away by it!  EA NBA Live 16 mobile app is now leaps and bounds behind!  Addictive. NEVER thought I would move to smartphone play. Love it!  ~ 1 year mobile device player  40 year console and PC player (since the start of Video consoles in 1977)",
        "Great game but I'll rate it 5 stars when cloth simulation can be enabled and the court sounds are thoroughly fixed. And ohh, Android 7.0 now supports Vulkan API. I hope you can work on it to make the gameplay smoother. And also, you're very slow at pushing updates unlike in iOS. What's taking you guys so long? Another thing, this game costs the same amount as the NBA 2k17 in iOS but some features are missing in Android! Make a major update of this game!",
        "Will we ever see better updates for this? I've played the iPhone version and I feel like 2K is favoring the iPhone more than the android. It has less issues and bugs than the android. I've always been a loyal fan of 2K because they have the best sports games.. and unfortunately this game isn't living up to the standard (android). Please keep updating it!! 4 stars for now",
        "MAKE IT SUPPORTED BY BLUETOOTH CONTROLLERS I have an ipega (PG-9023) controller here... But the problem is, the controller won't work because the game does not support a controller... The game was good nice graphics and im happy that you have an update and fixed the commentator sounds... But if you supported it with BT controller i would be so happy and rate it with 5 stars...",
        "Hmmm.. something beyond my expectation.. I didn't expect it works so good on my phone.. huawei Mate 9.. and appreciate works from the team to keep 2k16 controls here.. gameplay really smooth, might be better than ios.. but one thing that need the team really put in some consideration, the audiopack.. one piece of all that I think still far away from what I had in iPhone previously.. game without sound? Or with a sound that doesn't match to the game, you gotta be kidding me.. =/",
        "Same as 2k16 Only difference is career mode. Game play is exact same copy paste. Season mode is still terrible cause you can't advance to another season and draft auto generated rookies. You guys should add a mygm mode that would make this game so much better. No commentary and ok graphics on android. Even when you get an excellent release and A+ wide open, you still can't score. pls fix that. help defense, p/r, and spacing are broken"

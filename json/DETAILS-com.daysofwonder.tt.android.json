        "Should be 5 stars I love this game, both the board game and the app.  I haven't opened it in a while and was so excited to see local multiplayer.  Sadly, I was immediately disappointed when local multiplayer didn't work.  The devices won't connect and the app crashes.  If they can fix that, I'll give it 5 stars.  UPDATE: App no longer crashes after update.  Now, I just keep getting the \"Not Connected\" message.  I can see the open game server either direction, but can't get the game to connect.",
        "It's great,really. It captures beautifully all the mechanics of the real board game, minus the hassle of setting up the game. There's a problem though: In the Pass & Play mode, the objectives (tickets) of each player are supposed to be secret, yet the game highlights them and even displays the ticket cards face up. I hope the devs will address this in a future update, seriously how such important detail slipped the testing?",
        "Great game, very similar to the table top game but needs a play again button right after you finish a game. Seems clunky to have to go onto another screen to access game play again. Also, longest road could just flash instead of counting out the pieces but these are small niggles for such a great game.",
        "Love the game, app sucks For a long while now, the app wont start on my galaxy tab3. Tries verifying update, gets to 90%, then switches to homescreen of game before spontaneously closing.. at least 3 updates since and still no fix",
        "Freezes all the time then lets a bot take over and forces you to lose. Also notice that my score or karma change for the worse even if I haven't played. Love the game but it needs to work.",
        "It's a fun game to kill time. I had never played the board game prior to buying this game, but it was easy to learn. I wish there was a portrait mode option though as it would make it so much more comfortable to play."

        "You can do better EA. Amazing, but not good enough. Hasn't had more content added since before I got it, months ago. Hate the auto acceleration, needs free roam and more cars. Could also use more customisation. This game has really great graphics etc and has the potential to become the best android car game, but without those features that the pc one DOES have, even though mobile isn't as good, it still needs them, it isn't. Especially needs manual acceleration.",
        "5 bucks so what. Out of ALL the racing games \"play for free\"I found. They all mostly revolve around real money eventually.You can actually beat this game without spending a penny. The only thing is, the nfs editions are a bit pricey so save your money for those. I got like 90% of the cars. Got this like when it came out years ago. I still play and love it and I feel its Still one of the best racing games for android NO LIE even better than NO LIMITS. Best of all no online connection needed !Great graphics gameplay and fun!!!! I still play in 2017!!!",
        "Suggestions I love this game and play it often. I found that with the right strategy and learning how to drift effectively, you can reach 100% completion rather quickly. I have a couple suggestions and I know these are a lot to ask development wise  and also being that this is a moderately old game, so they aren't necessarily necessary but more things to consider. 1. A longer story mode with various difficulty levels 2. More profound vehicle customization (body kits, rims, more colours, permanent performance upgrades)",
        "No gamepad support other than Moga. Unfortunately, I bought it on the web Play Store and only installed it later, too late for getting a refund. The game looks great, really, but I bought it to play on my Android gaming tablet (with a built-in gamepad) and this doesn't support either X360 or PS3 gamepads. I'm sure the game would be fun. But no gamepad support. This is backwards. Would get a refund if possible.",
        "One of the best racing games üòÄüòÄüòÄ Super smooth, fun to play, and easy controls. It's really difficult to find a game like this in the play store. The best part it's only $4.99. You can get it cheaper when there is a sale, but the full price is worth it. I will rate this game 5 stars.",
        "Could be better Wish you could go free for all where you go drive around the city. The way you can drive to events. Then if you do something wrong cops would chase you. And the city would have cool stuff to drive on. Wish there could be multiplayer too. Make this update and I'll rate five stars. I'll tell my friends to get this family. Which is about 30 people."

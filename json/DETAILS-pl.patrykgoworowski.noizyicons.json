        "Awesome app. Thanks.",
        "First time using this dev. I appreciate your hard work. The dashboard is easily navigated. The included walls are appropriate. There are enough icons to easily cover your major icons & even those that are \"less popilar\". The Non-covered apps are themed appropriately so as to not distract from the overall general theme. If your partial to squared icons as I am then scoop this up & you'll be happy you did!!",
        "Icon packs nowadays are either variations of other icon packs, minimalistic versions of stock icons or icons mimicking the style of other OSes. However, this icon pack delivers something new and innovative. Instead of removing details, it adds more. Want to stand out? Noizy's got you covered.",
        "Beautiful and detailed icon pack loved it and developer is also actively fulfilling requests and updates weekly ! definately recommended to everyone."

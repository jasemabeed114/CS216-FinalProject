        "Somehow you made things worse with the top friends. I suggest you start listening to feedback... slowing down my phone too. I'll never understand how people can mess up something if it didn't even need fixing to begin with. You guys messed up even more stuff... Can't edit my profile stuff either. Edit button refuses to work too. I'd give zero stars if I could. You're not fixing anything, you're just making things worse. Edit: Edit button is still broken and top friends is still messed up. You people even listen to feedback? No of course not. You got it all down. No problems at all with Facebook.",

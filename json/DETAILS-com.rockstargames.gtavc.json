        "Awesome game, great port Same as original, you can get to the second and third islands at the start. No boats on the second island so don't get stuck there. Go to the third island, buy the one shack and then find 70 packages before you buy the condo. You can do all the side quests at the start except the chopper checkpoints. The firefighter missions will require you to somehow get a firetruck to the first island unless you can wait.",
        "I fondly remember playing Vice City on the PS2 when it first came out. This port is an excellent version of that game with some minor changes that I don't believe affect it negatively. First there are some songs taken out from the radio, the cost of buying business is much cheaper and easier overall and the controls (especially first person mode while shooting) are difficult to master. However, the game runs flawlessly and loads very quickly. It's takes on a minute or so to get into the game and causing chaos. I imagine with an external controller the game would be much more enjoyable but even with just touch controls it's very enjoyable.",
        "This game is great.....graphics are nice..still needs work but very nice. The controls are OK ...the brake button kinda malfunctions sometime. Other than that no complain here lol...it took 4 downloads to work good.....for anyone who wants to purchase ...do this 1. Download and install game 2. Leave the main GTA vice city purchase page 3. Go to my app page and Watch GTA download from downloads column 4. Once done just click on the icon from the same page 5. Should work...make sure you turn sleep off in settings so game has a better chance working :)",
        "Fun All these kids reviewing this game low. . This game is old and they aren't going to go in an edit anything. Its not made for a controller if u want to use a controller buy it on a console. If u don't have enough space on your device that's your fault for not reading the description. If its not working on your device email them they can help u out or give u a refund. They will never have gta5 on mobile it be like 10gb maybe more and drain ur battery in 1 minute.",
        "A- but loved it! Def better graphics than GTA III. Might have to tweak the display settings of you plan on using in different devices. Not all work flawlessly with high graphics. I wish there was a cloud setting or something to switch my saved info on to another device. Never the less this is still a classic as well and very happy with it! Lookong forward to get San Andreas!"

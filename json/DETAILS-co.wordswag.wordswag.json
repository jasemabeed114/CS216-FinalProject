        "I loved this app the first time I used it. Unfortunately that one time was the ONLY time this app worked properly. It is the first app I've actually paid for and so far it isn't worth a penny, because never works as it should. It won't add my logo and any time I use the back button it pixelates the photo so that it is unusable. I need this for work. Please fix the bugs or give me a refund. If fixed I'd happily give this five stars. In theory it is a great app and super user friendly. Again, IN THEORY.",
        "As of today 2/22 anytime i search the pixieset images it comes up no results ! Why???  I love it but i really wish you could adjust the text box width too. If I have a lot of text, it goes top to bottom but not to the sides.",
        "Well....this used to work great. Tried using it yesterday and it wouldn't open. Just a black screen. Update needed - so updated. Nothing.  3 days now and no change. Can't even open the app. I've waited for hours for it to open and nothing.   So what now? If I uninstall and reinstall it, will have have to pay again?   I've got a Samsung Note 3 if that helps?",
        "On LG G5, photos uploaded using camera roll section never pop up. No way to externally add from photos app either. Make app useless for me since I want to add text to my photos.",
        "Keeps freezing. I've had it for just over a month.  I've been trying to make a graphic quickly for the last 45 mins and nothing bc it crashes, freezes or won't open.  If I roll the dice to change the style more than 5x it's done for. I even did an uninstall.  Frustrating and I'll need a refund if it doesn't work soon.",
        "When I go to type onto the picture I've chosen (either from the search or adding my own), the picture turns to gray blocks and I can no longer properly place my text where I'd like because I can't see the picture... it started happening last week,  very disappointed."

        "Cloud Saved Worlds Whenever I try to go into the Cloud Saved World tab the game always force quits. I've tried undownloading and redownloading and I get the same results. I just went into the game and realized all my locally saved worlds were deleted. Similarly, a few days ago my only person was deleted and I thought someone else deleted it, but looking at other's comments it seems as if their characters were deleted too?? I'm about ready to just remove the game for good if this isn't fixed soon.",
        "The game is fun as heck, but... I'm leaving a one star review until 505Games decides to add Android HID controller support, especially considering that the PC version now has it, and the slow rise in android TV gaming setups. Heck, last I heard, it worked on the Amazon fire TV! If that is still the case, they have a controller enabled android apk already made! I'm considering a Shield TV, so being able to use the cloud save between that and my phone with a controller mount would be amazing!",
        "Game was amazing. I was in handmode had all adamantite armor and most npcs. But then something happened in the cloud... I went to go back on to it after showing how great of a game it is... then I went back on terraria and my character through the cloud was gone. I thought the cloud was to prevent things like this. I didn't even care about the music in the background putting my phone on sleep without exiting the app. Please contact me, I worked very hard on that character.",
        "I love Terraria on all platforms including this one but I downloaded it on the 3rd of march (Friday) then played it a lot, tried to play it in the car but when I went on the play tab it said that my character was 'created with a newer version of Terraria and could not be loaded. It is now Monday and I still can't access my old character. Please help me get my character back!",
        "Great but... I have this game on my Kindle also, but after a certain update it started crashing. So I got it on here. Could u make the option of 10 item slots vs 5? Maybe put them under the other ones and a little smaller. It's VERY helpful. But keep up the great work :D best game ever!!!",
        "Terraria  has always been a great game known for its great content.  I love that they have updated the phone version as well as PC version for it.  There is all new content and bosses you can defeat, just like the PC version!  Controls are a little difficult to learn, but you eventually learn them overtime.  I think Terraria is a must have game.  It is much better than those FTP games where they give you an option to purchase time affiliated stuff.  It is worth every penny to buy this game."

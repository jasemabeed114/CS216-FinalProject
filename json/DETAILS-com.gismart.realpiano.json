        "I loved this musical fun app, it highly enjoyable! I wonder if more songs can be added to the music selections? You sent a rating request when I already rated your app! I won't change my five star rating but I will if you keep annoying me!!",
        "First the keys kept stuck when you press them (after which you can't press them anymore) and now I can only do 1 key at the time after the update. Horrible app, not worth any money at all. Rubbish.",
        "I can't press more than 2 keys at the same time. Small Song collection. Sorry I can't give you 5 stars",
        "It keeps makeing me rate it there's barely any songs DONT GET",
        "Easy and enjoy to play.. please make your piano  setting the clock alarm with option some  song... perpect!!!",

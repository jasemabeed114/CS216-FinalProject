        "This game would get an enthusiastic 5 stars from me, but for some reason Robtop won't let you purchase the full game in the Google Play store. So, 3 stars for 3 awesome levels.   If they ever change that, then a definate 5 stars, no problem. Loved, loved and super loved the original Dash on both Newgrounds and the phone version. Just hate that I can't purchase the full version of this one. ðŸ˜Ÿ",
        "This game is highly addicting and, to say the least, difficult. However, it is not recommended for the common rage-quitter nor is it for one without patience. It takes practice to become good at this game (that's why there's a practice mode). There's tens of thousands of levels to enjoy beyond the built-in ones. The graphics are greatly improving and the (featured) user levels are without a doubt beautiful! For one person to develop such an amazing game takes lots of talent. Keep it awesome!  All in all, this game is super addicting and completely amazing. 5/5.",
        "One of the best games I had ever played in my life. If you have not downloaded it, DOWNLOAD IT NOW! If you can't buy the full version, you can always buy the lite version instead. :)  RubRub, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE 2.1 UPDATE! I have waited so long for this! Also tell me if there is going to be a 2.2 Update in the future :3  Overall EXCELLENT GAME!",
        "2.1 is great. But there is still issues. A app shouldn't take a year to get an update (Im gonna be in the grave by the time this app reaches 3.0), online is super laggy now, and online levels take forever to load, usually requiring many refreshes, and you keep releasing other GD apps (World and meltdown) without reason, why not just add them to the full game, and hardly any feedback or input from the devs, just an occasional tweet, and often leaves us in the dark. GD is a good game, but it could have better care",
        "It's fun, addictive, and all around awesome. Great soundtrack and lvls. There are 2 problems tho with the update: 1. When I beat a lvl or open a chest and then get out of the app after and then go back on it, it shows me as if I didn't even open the chest or that I beat that lvl. 2. I can't login to my account. It keeps telling me \"login failed\" every time. Plz fix this I don't want to restart from the beginning if let's say I break my phone. I have so much progress on it so plz fix quick.",
        "Great game! I have been playing for almost 2 years now (since 1.9) and it was wonderful seeing this community grow. Since 2.1 came, though, the game has been unstable and the server's crash repeatedly. I know this isn't my device because both the wi-fi and my tablet work perfectly with each other on any game besides this one. Please fix this issue and I will give 5 stars to this game..."

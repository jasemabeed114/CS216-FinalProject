        "You should add multiplayer because i like multi-player and multi-player is fun. We could add friends and play together and challenge or even spilt screen but only on ipads. That would make the game slightly better but this is just recommendation so don't take as as must but as a suggestion so pls make it true it will make a few people lives better because there will be no burden.",
        "Aaaargh it's so good! Epicly cartoony bloon popping action. Plenty of gameplay with endless scope for combinations of weapons and power-ups. Really well built for mobile, controls feel flawless and graphics are great. Will certainly be sinking hours of idle time into this fun game üòÅ",
        "Great game, awesome game play. Although, it's almost impossible to get platinum on some levels. Besides that, it only has 50 levels. But I'm sure they will add more soon so great game for now!",
        "Its a great game, loads of fun and very addictive.  Unfortunately sometimes the game can lag up making it somewhat unplayable.  Also a suggestion, id happily pay up to ¬£3.99 for permanent double blops",
        "While the game is very fun, it ends up feeling really grindy. Most levels feel artificially hard. The constant FPS drops almost make it unplayable. I hate to complain about a game, but this needs to be improved. Still really enjoying the game.",
        "There's a bug that keeps you from getting diamonds: if I pop a bloon while it's off-screen, the game won't register it. Also, put the epic activation on the side of the screen. It's annoying that I always move my monkey when I'm trying to activate epics."

        "I am a huge fan of exelent customer service. I sent email to support asking a question, (I looked in the forums for a while. Couldn't find anything) Within 24 hours I received an email back with a link to some solutions. Absolutely amazing. I did have an issue installing. And the link solved it. I am stunned and will recomends nothing but this app to anyone looking for an automation app. Seriously. This app is absolutely the most powerful automation app out there. And I will continue to use it.",
        "I recently purchased this app and I find it very useful it's so useful that I found that I can do 2 things with this one app that I'd need 2 separate apps for(locking apps and power management) and that's just the start. BUT I HAVE ONE MAJOR GRIPE, WHENEVER I OPEN TASKER IT FEELS LIKE IM RUNNING KITKAT AND THIS APP HAS BEEN UPDATED AS RECENT AS 2017!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOME MATERIAL DESIGN WOULD BE NICE ðŸ˜‰.",
        "I don't like it because it clears all my profiles I've made when I clear all applications. I'm not even sure I ever got the profiles to work and have just settled for manual activation of phone functions anyway. Additionally it had no access to my samsung galaxy's 'power saving' function and I couldn't set it up for a nightly toggle on and off.",
        "The concept is great, but it is impossible to use. The UI is among the worst I've ever seen. It doesn't follow a single standard Android design practice. Documentation is sparse and outdated. You'll spend hours fumbling your way through incomprehensible menus only to be more confused than when you started. Making anything of even modest complexity will make you pull out your hair.",
        "Powerful and feature-rich I got this app to help do some small things like change the ringer volume automatically when I get to work, or change the brightness when I wake up. Lately though, I'm finding much more interesting things to do, like manage off-site backups and automatic weather and theme swapping for day/night. And I'm only scratching the surface of what I can do with this app!",
        "It is ~~one of~~ the best automation tool for Android. Tasker is behaving weird. It doesn't recognize files when use root is selected. It gives error that it is a dir. Checking file size always gives 1 when root is used, and without root, it doesn't start the action. In marshmallow it worked fine, but it is having problem in CM 14.1 ðŸ˜¢ Still not fixed in latest update."

        "I am happy with the game. The overall appearance and quality is amazing. I have a few concern. You need to have more things available to buy in the shop. You need to let the player feel in control of the shop, so allow them to move around the items that you buy. There should be mini games like the PC version so it doesn't get boring after a while. Lastly, the player should be able to customize their character, Ex. Hair, eyes, eye color, shoes, tops and bottoms, earrings, glasses ect. Not all people like the same.",

        "Absolutely awesome icons pack. I got it for free and it absolutely blew my mind. What I love more is the fact that masked icons look hell lot better than other available icon packs in play store. Most of the other icons pack leave a ugly white space around unthemed icon but yours method makes them fit with the icon pack. Any other method for payment? Since I got it free I love to pay for it. A big thanks to you, Dev.",
        "Great looking, comprehensive, minimal icon pack! I probably get more annoyed than I should when the inevitable apps without a custom icon don't look similar to the custom ones, and this does a great job of \"circlefying\" these icons without leaving a bunch of white space.",
        "Gets stuck on \"checking license\" on start up. Nexus 6P running 7.1.1  Edit: uninstalled & installed it again, worked after that. Nice icons for the most part!",
        "Best looking icon pack I have. I only wish it had icons for all the apps I have.",
        "Great Icon pack. And even more great when you get it for free ðŸ˜‰",

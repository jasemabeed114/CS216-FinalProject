        "After I am done calling, the phone keeps believing that i am still on the call and i cannot open my camera as it says, \"Camera cannot be opened during calls.\" Also, I keep having low ringtone and notification volume for the same reason. When i try to increase the ringtone volume, my phone only gives me the option to increase the call volume. I have to restart my phone every time to fix this issue; either the camera does not open or the ringtone volume goes down. Other than that, the application works fine with me."

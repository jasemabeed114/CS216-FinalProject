        "Love the Podcast Addict app to tears. As I was looking through it I realized I could make those go away with the donation app. Totally worth it to me. The hours I've poured into Podcast Addict and how intuitive it's been through the whole time has more than earned that donation from me.  It's a well-made app (thanks, by the way, for preserving SD card support), and if you love something, you should support the creators.",
        "This is absolutely the most used app on my Google Play XL. I definitely felt that supporting the author by removing the ad banners was well worth it. Hopefully one day it will have Cloud support for playlists, downloads, etcetera but that doesn't stop this from being the best podcast app on the market.",
        "I really like it. Even bought it. I would like the option of manually choose or typing (not dragging the playback thing) the time we left of listening. Sometimes I accidentally skip the podcast or drag the playback thing and can't seem to easily go back to where I was. Especially with larger podcasts. An option to type the minute: second  would be awesome.",
        "It's a great app, and I use it all the time. One complaint is if you want to search for podcasts it is kind of hard with its three word limit. When you type Chinese three words are a lot, and it's almost impossible to discover new podcast by typing in search terms.",
        "I use this app so much I felt compelled to donate (even though I didn't mind the little banner ads). I've never had any technical issues on my HTC phone and I love the layout and features. I saw a few negative reviews complaining that the interface wasn't instantly intuitive. How spoiled we've become! I'm glad the app has lots of features, and was more than willing to spend a little time learning how to use them. I hope the developer ignores those lazy-brained haters and keeps up the excellent work!",
        "Use it every day. The best podcast app I've used! It makes keeping track of all your podcasts much easier."

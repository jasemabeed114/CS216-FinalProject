        "This game has had me addicted since Hunter Island. I've been playing it forever and put about $400.00 into this and have I have only gotten 6 Legendairies. Don't get me wrong the prices for gems are outrageous. I wish I got weekly legendairies like I do in other games. Other than that, I absolutely love this game",
        "Great game and I'm enjoying it so far.   Neo Monsters certainly does have a similar 'feel' to the Pokémon series (The Original).  My only issue and one others have raised, the movement style makes the game feel clunky and doesn't seem as solid as the joystick methods you see in other similarly styles games.  It would be awesome to get a choice on movement/controls.  Finally, Neo Monsters does seem to be somewhat P2W the further in depth a player starts to get.",
        "Not sure where to Start.. 1 gem - 1 euro seems insane while game is 50cnt. P2w IS way out of hand in badly designed ripoff Pokemon game. Gosh.",
        "Gr8 game. Eggs are still expensive and legendary monsters does not come easily. Wish there is another way to acquire de-aging fruit by buying them also for the potions to be bought by jewels",
        "The 10x drop rate for legendary monsters is a lie. Don't spend any money on this game unless u wanna get crappy monsters and waste money and if you do wanna waste your money and get terrible monsters, by all means go ahead .",
        "Its a really fun game. One of my faves. Only issue is starting screen gets to about 75-80% loaded and stops loading so can't play atm :("

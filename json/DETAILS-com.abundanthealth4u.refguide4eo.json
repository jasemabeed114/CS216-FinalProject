        "Absolutely thrilled now that the app has been updated to work on my new phone. This is my only go to app for oil usage and I will be recommending it to all my customers again.",
        "Amazing",
        "Previously I would give this five stars, but now I have to give it one star because I just upgraded my phone to a LG V20 and when I went to re-install the app through Google Play I got the message of \"Your device isn't compatible with this version.\"  I use this app all the time and now I can't.  I am so disappointed.",
        "Not updated with paper guide Recent update (11/2016) doesnt include blends such as Slique Essence which has been out since 2014! Also, some listed ingredients conflict with what is listed on brand new bottles. Expensive for inaccurate information.",
        "Love this!!! I use the reference guide constantly. Its very easy to use and quick to look things up. Needs to be updated with new products but, thats my only complaint. Still love it!",
        "Love this app! When will it be updated for the Nougat OS? I would love it if the developer would respond. I have left comment on here and emailed them 2x."

        "Two big issues I have with Snap chat. First, it will heat the device up, drain your batteries down to nothing and is slow even if you have 8 cores on your device. Second, why do you need to verify my device? As long I In login with my password and user name, you shouldn't be snooping. Last,  it tracks your phone location very aggressively; even with your phone is closed.",
        "Kinda sucks for android users cos it makes the phone hot, laggy, screen froze, and crashes a lot. At times the filter function doesn't even work properly. It seems to be going great on iPhones tho. Sadly not so much for Androids. And when it's laggy, it's really bad.",
        "The app crashes on me about 5 to 6 times a day out of the blue and it's getting really annoying, could be my phone itself but not sure. I would give it 5 if it wouldn't crash all the time.",
        "The most recent update fixed the issues with the app crashing; however, there is still severe lag and overheating issues while using the app. At least the app is now somewhat usable again. Still waiting for the remaining bugs to be patched.",
        "Bad quality videos. But good with pictures. What deal snapchat? Those videos really are bad i must say. Didnt have this problem before but i forgot which update got me into this. Pls fix it...im begging you!",
        "It's so laggy and almost unusable...  I have had this app for a while enjoyed it and then recently every time I open the app it takes a long time and when I tap on snaps from people it takes about 30 seconds to load and sometimes it thinks that I have already seen it when it had only been loading.... I have an Alcatel idol 4 and no other apps are as laggy as Snapchat..."

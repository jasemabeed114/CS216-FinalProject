        "I loved it. It is amazing to collect your favorite characters from DC nation and the show itself. And the fact to battle them too is great. The only bad thing about it is that I see little glitches in the figures and I don't get many side activities because I think I used them all but please create more. But other than that, it's great and very creative. Side note: great graphics! ü§ó",
        "Super fun, and great value while it's on sale I love collecting and battling games and this one is pretty great. Lots of jokes and funny stuff going on but the funnest part is opening the riddler packs cause you can get literally any figure from them. For 1 dollar it's deffinitely worth it. Give it a try!",
        "Really cute. Amazing graphics!üòò It doesn't need Internet which is good because I need it at home but now I'm at my Dad's place, and he has Internet. It may cost money but it is great! Half demon. Cyborg. Enthusiastic leader. Alien princess. Boy that turns into üêàüêíüêïüêÜüêñüêèüêêüêé",
        "Fun and addicting game.  But controls are bad enough to drop my rating to 3 stars. Toon kinda runs wherever tf it wants to during flash sale game, and good luck making it over a couple bridges. The game can't tell if your tapping the bridge or the street under it, so your toon just runs back and forth",
        "Great game. Scratch your DC and Pokemon itch at the same time! Though not a huge Teen Titans Go fan, I loved the original series, but I'm glad for TT Go's tonal change as it allows for this great game to exist as a natural extension of the show, which will surely please fans, perhaps even those who only really watched the old series like myself. Mechanically, Teeny Titans Go, fuses Pokemon and JRPG charge-bar combat to a very satisfying result. Ultimately it's a great game for all ages. Don't let the 9 to 12 fool you.",
        "When I first saw this game I thought it was just a money grab, but after paying the small amount for it initially I found out this is genuinely one of the funnest apps I have played in a long time. No micro-transactions to mooch money just pure fun and good humor. Could use a slightly bigger character list and some more events, but sure they will come in time. Definitely worth the small sum."

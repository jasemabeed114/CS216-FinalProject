But it should not use any storage i can not get it on my phone so my stupid HUAWEI phone does nothing at all SO FIX IT!!!!!",
        "I play this game every ingle day and have some of my favourite world's with redstone and fun builds. Me and my best friend love to join world's and build amazing structures I definitely recommend this game. Just please can you add pistons, becons and colored glass please... I am quite disappointed because the last couple of updates are just skins! I still love this game but improve the game not the skins.",
        "Its now required to have an internet connection to play with someone who right in front of you. And most of the time even though we're connected to our own hotspot or our own network  we can't find each other. if they simplify it and make so that we can play offline I'll change my rating until then I don't recommend that you buy this",
        "I like it, but with this new update (1.0.5) it deleted all of my severs that i am on and it changed my skin to the default. The game also changed my gamer tag back to Steve. Why did this happen? Other then that i love the game! It's addicting, fun, and it allows players to be creative!",
        "Add every block/mob that minecraft pc into minecraft pe please please please. If you do 5 stars ☆☆☆☆☆ forever. Includes: armour stands, stained glass, command BLOCKs, mods, wither storm,  book and quill (write able book), custom elytra, shulker chest, custom trading (chest under villagers left is trade for right is gets and it for the chest then villager trades that), ....etc. =D and MY SERVERSSSSSSSS =(",
        "One of the most addicting games I've ever played, a great time killer! Definitely worth the $7. I am patiently waiting for any new update to be released! I highly recommend this game to all ages! A bit of nostalgia with the 3d pixel graphics, aswell. There are options to switch it for lefties, too!"

        "A good challenge with excellent replay value Love it. Have wanted the table top version for a while but my friends and family aren't much for these types of games. This one is very well done. My only complaint is the continuous requirement the click the continue to the next infection button. Otherwisr, I strongly recommend this game, well worth the price and with the expansion there are a seemingly endless number of combinations to choose from.",
        "Great co-op game! My sister got this board game for Christmas and the app is a perfect version of the real thing.  Only wish list is ability to play others over Bluetooth.  This would be an awesome game for any flight.  Also a play online, with or without friends option (non Bluetooth) would also be a great addition.  When I travel back home I'd love to play with family this way.  With multiplayer (not shared phone) a chat function would be nice too.",
        "I absolutely love this board game and the app makes it so I can play by myself since no one wants to play as often as me. I like that you can zoom in on the board but I actually don't need to most of the time,  there as only been one incident where my fat fingers sent me somewhere i did not want to go, and there is an undo button just for that problem too. I appreciate how well the undo button is set up because it cannot be abused and also how all the information you need is easily accessible. I would definitely recommend this to someone like me, however I do think that the actual board game is better if playing with people.",
        "This is the gold standard for all board game apps.  A perfect tutorial which introduces the rules of the game could in itself be a great introduction to the card based board game alone, and make a great training tool. Then the lovely touch interface which brings all the info you need within easy reach, rounds it off. The visuals are exactly as you know from the original game and the only thing missing is connected multiplayer, wifi locally or net play. Can't wait to see what else this dev can translate digitally. Highly recommended.",
        "Getting oriented Vertigo and tiny important features make the first few games seem harder. The auto zoom and pan with flashing disease cubes spinning and so forth made me long for my quiet board game. (\"Tabletop\" video Wil online if you haven't tried it analog.) This game lets you examine all players cards, forecasted cards, played cards... Expand the left and right columns and pay close attenton to when you use forecast. It's easy to slip.",
        "A nearly flawless implementation of a fantastic game Pandemic is a great board game.   This is a faithful port of the game with an intuitive interface, excellent tutorial, and very good graphics. The only thing I don't like is the achievement system, requiring a Google Gamer account. It nags you until you create one."

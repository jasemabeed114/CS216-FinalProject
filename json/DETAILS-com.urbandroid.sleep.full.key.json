        "Unlock did not work I really enjoyed the trial version of the application a lot and really wanted to unlock the full version. So I purchased the unlock using the same Google play account as used to download the trial app. However, it still says my app is locked and skips multiple nights in a row. I tried reaching out to the support team and got a link to their FAQs. When those did not resolve my issue I replied to the email but received no further assistance. Will give 5 stars once issue is resolved.",
        "Love it Can I make a small suggestion. I love setting beautiful epic soundtracks as my ring tone. I live waking up to beautiful music but I'd prefer to have the song play until the end. Would it be possible to have the music and vibration start low and build up (which it currently does) and when the alarm is \"silenced\", it turns off thee vibration but continues to play the music.",
        "Poor support There seems to be no way to \"learn\" an MR Code for the purpose of stopping a wakeup alarm. When I click on the green \"learn\" button it turns on my camera, but nothing happens from there. I've contact support three times about this issue and they shrug me off, ignore me, or send a reply that doesn't even address my issue.",
        "Awesome; except sonic feature This app was golden until I tried the newly added sonic feature (as opposed to the original accelerometer). It completely drained my battery overnight WHILE it was plugged in which made me late to work. Aside from that, it's incredible!",
        "Used to be better The tracking for movement and noise has stopped working the same with one of these last updates. Also the 'Thank you' screen when you open it is irritating. Surely it would be better to prompt those who have the free version instead of having that EVERY time I open the app! You pay to get the full version and get rid of adds, not to have an unskippable screen. Will delete soon if glitches aren't fixed.",
        "Problems with the alarm I really enjoy all of the Sleep functions of this app. But I've had a lot of problems with the alarms. They go off even when I've tried to turn them off, and sometimes to stop them from ringing I have to restart my phone. It's very inconvenient. Even when I've closed all of the apps I'm using, the alarms keep ringing and I can't find a way to dismiss them."

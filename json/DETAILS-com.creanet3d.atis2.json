        "A perfect VR experience. Update: I have a new phone and downloaded the latest version of this and I am even more impressed, as there's now more content and even better visual.  Interesting areas of traveral. The bonus game made me feel sick though. Much better than the original. Worth the money.",
        "Wonderful...only one thing I'd change. Loved it! I wish I could easily go from the first to the second. As it is now, I have to remove my phone, close the first one and then open the second. An easy transition would truly make this the best. My 8 year old son loves this. I can't wait for the third.",
        "Very good Very nice work guys nice little journey for a tiny amount of money considering the amount of hours that goes into development of these projects.  Can't see where to donate to assist further projects.  Thank you Rob",
        "Pearl in the sea of mediocrity Again these people shown what the quality is!!! Good job Creanet, keep it this way and you will be the stars people ;)",
        "ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž So still no new content after purchase. The asteroid game is not gonna cut it. Great for what it is a game trailer then a to be continued after that but looks to be good but the developers are as#holes so I don't expect much from it.... And to the developers I will gladly take my 99c refund and play the free version so make it happen",
        "Truly immersive! What a wonderful concept! Dying for the third part. How soon is the third part gonna be out? Definitely gonna donate. Is there any date set for the release of the third part?"

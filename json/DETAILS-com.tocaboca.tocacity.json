        "GREAT game but some problems I really like this game it's fun , cute game and it's so cool you can do it your way! And be creative! But I like to move stuff like my way so that's what I did then a couple days later it restarts everything! Then one day I was putting a outfit on a girl and the outfit frozed  it was in the air like a ghost and I couldn't put it on her so I needed to restart it so please fix and thank you :)",
        "Loving it I absolutely love‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§this app is amazing love all the stuff you can use in it. But I think that can add even more interest  if you add like a cafe and like an elevator like toca vacation and like things that you have in a city. (High school , steam boat,cruise ship, fair/carnival, mall,motels, ect.) but overall it's just a great app maybe if add you these things people will enjoy it even more thank you for creating this appüòâüòÄüòÑüòÜ also one last thing I think iyou could combine some of them that be cool",
        "Great game I love this game it's so much fun. But may I suggest a couple of things. Retail. Buying new houses instead of being in one tiny apartment. Also instead of everything being free why don't you add jobs and add prices to everything. Sorry, just one more things. Instead of having EVERY person in town as your character just have one and if the person wants another character then they press a few buttons then. BAM. Like magic they have another character to play with along with there original.",
        "Love the game and i say \"Thank you\" to whom created this game. I have an idea, i hope you will accept it. Why don't you make Toca life: Hollywood? There'd be models, theatre or Cinema, talent show and a boutique to design the actress and models. And why not a cafeteria for the models or a caf√©? Your choice. And for the fashion show, please create a radio speaker and cd for music! I'm so excited if you would make this. Sadly, today is my Birthday and... I don't think i can buy that game. So, please make on game that is free and is a Toca Life. Thank you, and good luck.‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",
        "AMAZING I absolutely love this game and i just got the update. Amazing. To all those looking at the amount to pay and thinking whether it is worth it, just think about whether you want something to spend your time on and enjoy every second doing it. Trust me. I do.                                                          There is a few problems though. 1) when i exit a place, sometimes the things i had previously did was cancelled. 2) i cant make the people drink water 3) sometimes my characters cant wear masks.",
        "Great app Well my sister who is 3 had this app and she asked me to play it with her and I thought it would be a dumb baby app(like most of the games she plays) but it was actually a lot of fun and I ended up buying it for my self and I'm 11! but its surprisingly a lot of fun. the only things I would change is I  wish there were more than 1 apartment and I wish the people had names. This game is worth the money.:-)"

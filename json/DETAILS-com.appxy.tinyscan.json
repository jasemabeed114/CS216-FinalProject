        "As a music teacher and musician, I use this app constantly! It's perfect for making clean PDF copies of music to send to my students and other musicians I perform with. The copies look better than the original most times. I will recommend this app to anyone. (and do!) I couldn't imagine life before it!",
        "4 stars because it's always blurry when you use the flash, even though it focuses before you snap it.  Knock 1 more star because it keeps asking me to rate it in the app, but only gives me the option to rate 5 stars.  I paid for this!",
        "Didn't used it for long but great app. You need to pay to have a proper version though, free version is quite basic and limited. I just regret we're not able to navigate between scan from a same folder. You have to come back and select the next document you want to check. Could be a great improvement.",
        "As far as a doc. scanner for mobile devices this app is cream of the crop for me. I've tried others and this one is hands down the best I've used. So good in fact, i purchased the pro version. Its simple to use, works extremely better than expected. I love it!",
        "Works fantastic this way I don't have to try to find a fax machine I drive a semi for a living and it makes everything very easy thank you tiny scanner",
        "App makes ok scans but have yet been able to email any of them. Keeps telling me there is a error."

        "this is one of those apps that are free for a limited time and i download just to have never thinking Id actually use it.  Glad to say I was totally wrong. it really works and definitly noticed a difference how my eyes feel after long screen time. slick, easy to use interface with just enough options to not be overwhelming. now considering it a must have app!",
        "Needs location based scheduling for night mode. Takes up a lot of memory compared to other apps in the category. Launching other overlay apps causes the screen brightness to go back to normal, which is kinda glitchy. This should be on top of everything else so that the brightness stays the same. Kindly update.",
        "This is an excellent blue light filter app. I find Twilight's notification options a bit underwhelming and it doesn't have filter color options, but I miss the sunset scheduling and Twilight gives a description and color temperature on the adjustment slider.",
        "Too bad... To bad this app doesn't support filtering of the transparent navigation bar. How much I like the rest of the app and all the features. I am installing it.",
        "This really is brilliant. I got the free version and upgraded to pro just a couple days after I got it all set up. I have major light sensitivity due to my Severe ME, and so using devices can be very painful for my eyes and cause migraines too. I tried twilight but there were certain aspects that didn't work for me... and I like how eye filter is designed for all day use, though the pro version does have a basic (but reliable!) scheduling function on it, if that works better for you. It's very customisable, with different coloured filters, and I also like how it has a button you can place on your home page to quickly turn it on and off. (though note - you have to remove the button as well as the filter every time you need to change permissions for any app - this is a security function of Android though, not an issue with the app itself!). This app works  brilliantly and has definitely reduced eye pain!!",
        "Sucks It's crashing like hell. I can take it no longer. Please release an update, resolving this issue."

        "It doesnt work I was able to play for about 30 minutes. I exited to google how to buy groceries so i can cook and it gave me the same error message it gave back in march. I tried force close and it did the same thing. Please fix i was really enjoying up until that point. Sims is my all time favorite game and i don't like freeplay it takes too long. I paid 7.43 for this game. :,,C",
        "Very disappointed.... The clothes selection sucks theres not alot of clothes to choose from including hair styles also why cant you have pets? Or move in with another sim or have kids the sims freeplay is so much better this sims needs to be as good as sims 3 on the computer come on sim creators i know you can do better than this!! we payed for this REMEMBER?!?!üò° make this game worth buying.......",
        "OMG! There is no reason of this game. It won't even load for me . U should REALY update this game to where it's actually to when I CAN PLAY ON IT! I payed a LOT of money for this! Sims doesn't cost ANYTHING and it's SO much better! Did you hear that!!!??? SO much better. I hope you get the SO part. If it costs money, actually make it GOOD! Take my word other people, this is something you DONT want to waist your money on. Please, don't use the money you worked hard for and earned, for this mean money-taking app.",
        "It's time for an upgrade!! Game is too easy. After awhile,controling only one sim at a time becomes boring. Its the SIMS 3 there should be baby making all over this game. Having more skills would've be nice and make the skill above 5. 5 is too easy to get too. Please upgrade the max on promotion, $300 a day is to easy to reach. Downloading and playing is good. (SiM3) Overal,i would like some new updates. Like what you did with freeplay sims.",
        "Kids! I lovee this game, so much. Its really good, better than any other. Except i really wanna have kids in the game and it sucks cause you cant. Also the cloths! Gosh i really wish their were more off them. I dont like the cloths or hairstyles. Ill give 5 stars if we get those to things changed up",
        "Wow u guys r haters I love it its worth it no problems except i wish it was free nothing i can do about that so its perfect life changing in a good way and gets you prepared for the future wow please comment about my comment and think positive not negative no have a good day god bless u all now. Peace out chall yo and outüòÄüòäüòùüòúüòúüòúüòúüòùüòÑüòÉ"

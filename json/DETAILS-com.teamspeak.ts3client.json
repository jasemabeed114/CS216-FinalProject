        "The app is now working good again. Can you please upgrade the UI in your next update? We would love to see a minimalist design of your app, or at least make skin packs work on android. Thx! Keep it up!",
        "3 crashes within 5 minutes, not worth the memory it's saved in. Somehow it crashes when it's not even open. I can't believe it's possible to sell software this bad (Nexus 5, Android 6.0.1)",
        "Constantly crashing in the background when the app isn't even needed. It shouldn't even be running in the background unless I'm connected to a server.",
        "Has been using background data for the last couple months, even though I haven't been using it. Also it started crashing in the background when I'm not using it over the last week.",
        "as someone else said it's now stopped working on samsung galaxy 7 edge. perfect before latest update march 2017",
        "App crashes since last update (March 2017) even when I'm not using it, please fix this"

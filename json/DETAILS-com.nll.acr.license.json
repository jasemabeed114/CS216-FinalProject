        "Used the free version fir over a year I just made the purchase because I use it allot!  Fantastic app works as you would expect it to.   I Would take off a half point because I want it to record calls only from numbers outside my contacts list.   The additional option to record via blue,  however,  overrides that and records every call if my BT is on.   My BT is always on.   That said,  super awesome app at a 4.5 star rating.",
        "Absolutely Awesome! This app is so worth the money! It records both sides of the phone call and call quality is great! Couldn't ask for anything better! I haven't had any issues whatsoever but I would make sure it's compatible with your phone just in case. Great job guys! Keep up the good work! -Samsung G6",
        "App doesn't work on android 6.0 non rooted stock ROM Oneplus 2 phone but other apps work fine This app used to work fine earlier but didn't work on android 6.0 stock ROM non rooted on Oneplus 2 phone. Emailed but devs blame phone instead of rubbish coding of app. Don't waste your money on this app as devs won't sort issues. Buy something that actually works instead. Even free version of boldbeast recorder works fine for manual recording by pressing red button on receiving / making call but bought pro version for auto recording which works flawless unlike this app.",
        "This app allows me to record all of my future ex-husband calls and his secretary and record the conversations with my kids as well. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and others download is a must does not work with phones. At least the end paid version I just bought the license today",
        "Few little quirks BUT all in all I love it. I will give it a straight up 5 if it could be set so you could rename the files when it asks if you want to save them or not.  What would be even better is if it looked in my contact list and named its files by the name attached to the number. I also would love to know what all it will work on. I have a galaxy s3 and want to upgrade my phone and don't know if I can go beyond the s4 to an s5 and that it would still work. Do that and I would be rating it way over a 5.",
        "Worth The Price! Installed on a Samsung Galaxy S III (model SCH-I535 on Verizon). Most apps of this type usually record using a setting such as \"Audio source (MIC)\", and only records half of the conversation well. This app's developer implements a \"workaround\" that you simply choose to enable or disable, that I can confirm successfully records both ends of the conversation with clarity on my device. There isn't any competitor to this app that I can make this claim of, which more than justifies the license fee. :)"

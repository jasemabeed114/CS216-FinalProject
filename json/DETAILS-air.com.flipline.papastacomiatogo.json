        "Hate the top down topping container system but it just takes getting used to and being careful. Another great game by flipline. Things are always changing and you earn new items.",
        "Another great game by Flipline. I find the toppings a bit more tricky than in previous games, but it doesn't take away from the game very much.",
        "Why do people complain about the price? It's less than the price of a bag of M & M's! Plus the gameplay is in point. Awesome game. Please make more!",
        "I love this Game, so cute, simple and awesome Hope u can make more game like these, i really want to play the Papa Cheeseria on Android. Hope u can make that for android too &lt;3",
        "It will need some bug fix specifically on the grill, build, and chip station. I will say its an another success of flipline.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! I really like the computer version, but this one is way more fun! At a cheap price as well!"

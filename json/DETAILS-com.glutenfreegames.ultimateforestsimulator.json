        "Like it but please get rid of the restart button because you can just restart by deleting and reinstalling and I had my sister playing it and she pressed the reset button and I lost everything can you please try to give me back my progress? I was level 15 and it took me so long to get to that level and I had a second bear and everything. Please try to give me back my progress",
        "I love this game I am on level 10 but I am always playing the bear because it's so cute! I really want to be the squirrel so I can climb trees but please please make a   ulmate bever simulator were you can swim underwater and I would like the boss battle to be a eagle please make that I'm begging you!",
        "Great! Only problem is that the controls can go slow and glitch up. When i attack in water i go through the water? It lags a lot. Thank you for creating amazing games! Maybe ultimate reptile SIM? Or dog simulator? Maybe even a ultimate snow SIM with loads of snowy animals!",
        "YAAAAAAY you should make a werewolf sim just like this with a huge forest, snow land, and city that would be awesome. Also add different species of werewolves like the twilight saga one with more pack openings. Five to  nine at least or what ever. Please.",
        "It's pretty good other than a few glitches like the fish flying out of the water. I have a few game suggestions such as Ultimate Snake sim or ultimate bug sim or ultimate arachnid sim. One thing bugs me though, it is so freaking hard to level up! Can you make it easier to level up? It's driving me crazy.",
        "Overall I think the game is great but there are a few bugs, which is okay. Like for example when you're a bat and you're carrying a stick, it keeps moving you in the wrong direction even if you're not touching the joystick thing or any of the buttons on the right. Also when I eat something with my cougars, their eating animation doesn't show up. Only animation is from my cougar that I'm playing as. Nevertheless the game is a spectacular simulator, and I would suggest it to people who enjoy animals and nature."

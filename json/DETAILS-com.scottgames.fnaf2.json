        "Awesome and Challenging!!!!!üòÑüòÉ I started off with fnaf 3 i never really knew how to play until i got jumpscared! I had to search it up on how to play, now im a fnaf addict! Only night im struggling on is the 6th night cuz all the animotronics pop in my office so im always hiding in that mask the marionette is hard to conceal due to that and BB turns my flashlight off Foxy never knows when to QUIT!!!! Scott i admire your work its great! And u make these games so fast! Crazy fast i hope FNAF 4 is just as challenging! Keep up the good work!",
        "This is Freddy,Bonnie and Chicha... Welcome to your night job at the new and improved Freddy fazbears pizzeria. Where we love all our customers and even have interactive animatronics! But...well you see there are some...bad bits about this job. The animatronics welllll. They may try and get you and stuff you into a suit. Also the old ones in the back are able to walk around as well. There is also an old indo skeleton walking around as well, and a golden Freddy, your flashlight has a limited amount of power, so welcome to the team, have fun ;)",
        "ITS SCARY AND NERVE RACKING This game has to be one of my all time favorites... it's truly amazing and stands out as a unique approach to horror games, watching the cameras, winding up the box not knowing if there's animatronic waiting for you when your done, and creating your own strategy to defend yourself and survive the night, i made it to the sixth night and I have yet to beat it after a couple of days.. the game is fantastic, fun, and entertaining I LOVE it",
        "Great game + challenging Oh noo a number two!!! Oh well it's better this way üëçScott great game again! I mean I was wanting a number two just one thing Toy Freddy is kind of chubby but oh well he can eat all the pizza he wants! anyway this game is great I can tell scott put a lot  of work and time into this game! I am so excited to play the third one these games are coming so fast its hard to beat all of them any way have fun and good luck BYEEEEEEE",
        "The Perfect Sequel This is the perfect sequel And probably my favorite fnaf game. Besides the first one of course. Part three isn't so good but is still pretty fun. part four is OK, but the design of the animatronics, well its like they are trying too hard for them to be scary. Can't wait for Sister location to come out for phone. Keep up the good work Scott.",
        "Welcome to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's pizza. Everybody loves the place, it's fun for everybody during the day, but the night shift tells a different story. Our Night Guard tells us that the animatronics attempt to get into his office and kill him. But that's just during the night. Everybody (except the night guard) leaves before dark. Come to Freddy Fazbear's pizza, where fantasy and fun come to life! P.S. Hope you enjoy the game, because I LOVE it. Perfection, Scott Cawthon. Perfection."

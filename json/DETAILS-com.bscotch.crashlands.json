        "Just a ton of fun. This is a game that blends the beautiful minimalism of the old 8-bit games with the expansiveness of modern gaming. I don't expect to run out of things to do or get bored anytime soon. No way to really describe this unique game well without boring everyone to death, which is the opposite of a helpful review. You're just going to have to trust, like, everyone who's played it and just go for it!",
        "This is the best game I've played on mobile. It's pace is aggressive enough to keep you interested for hours yet relaxed enough you can play for 10 minutes. I have been playing this game for probably 10 hours so far and still have a long ways to go. If you're even slightly interested in this game, don't hesitate.  It's worth the money. Also check out Quadropus, this game put me onto Butterscotch Shenanigans.",
        "This may be the best $5 I've spent in my life. Intuitive gameplay, fun and challenging combat, and a great inventory and crafting system to tie it all together. This deserves every star I could possibly muster. Don't believe me? Get it now and slap everything! Cheers, Bscotch. Another great game! What are you waiting for? Woanope awaits!",
        "Amazing game. Fantastic humor in just the right places. Controls are fantastic, and swap on the fly when transitioning from touch to a Bluetooth controller. Only two issues I have is occasional crashes (three over last hour), as well as the map chunks not loading properly. Thankfully there's an option within the map to redraw it for just this reason.",
        "I enjoy that this game takes care of a lot of the mundane tasks for you.  You don't need to manage your inventory, and there are a lot of way points to use on the map which cuts down walking time.  All that leaves you with more time to actually enjoy the quests and gameplay.  The playtime of this game was a lot longer than I expected.  It was also challenging at times, but never in a frustrating way.",
        "I hate giving 5 stars to any games but damn this game is good. So much content here. Highly polished, wonderfull characters, imagination. Even item descriptions are often humorous. Yet at its core its all about the gameplay. It also takes a reasonable time to finish storyline and can go back later to complete items/alt quests after storyplot."
